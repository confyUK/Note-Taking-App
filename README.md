## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/confyUK/Note-Taking-App.git
   cd Note-Taking-App
2.Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. If not, install Docker from the official site.

3. Build and run the Docker containers:
     docker-compose up --build
4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:80 to view the frontend of the application.
    The backend API is available on http://localhost:5000
   Usage
Frontend
The frontend is built with React and can be accessed via http://localhost:80.

Users can create new notes, view existing notes, update them, and delete them.

Backend
* The backend API is built with Node.js and Express.

* Endpoints include:

   * GET /api/notes: Fetch all notes

   * POST /api/notes: Create a new note

   * PUT /api/notes/:id: Update an existing note

   * DELETE /api/notes/:id: Delete a note

The backend connects to a MongoDB instance to persist the notes.

Docker
This application is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose. The docker-compose.yml file defines three services:

* frontend: React application serving the user interface.

* backend: Node.js application providing the API.

* mongo: MongoDB database for storing the notes.

You can easily build and run the entire application with:
  docker-compose up --build
